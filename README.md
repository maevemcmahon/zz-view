# ZZ-View: An <i>in situ</i> hybridisation image browser

This HTML/Javascript browser (using the FabricJS library) is designed to allow users to interact with <i>in situ</i> hybridisation images. 

Hybridised sections are loaded in a table format (rows = experimental conditions). Basic image filters (grayscale, contrast, brightness, saturation) can be used to modify the images.

ZZ-View is named after its original purpose: to simplify the viewing of <u>z</u>ebra finch <u>Z</u>ENK-hybridised sections.
