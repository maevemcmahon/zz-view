# zz-view: An <i>in situ</i> hybridisation image browser

This HTML/Javascript code (using the FabricJS library) is designed to allow users to interact with <i>in situ</i> hybridisation images. 

Hybridised sections are loaded in a table format (rows = experimental conditions). Basic image filters (grayscale, contrast, brightness, saturation) can be used to modify the images.
